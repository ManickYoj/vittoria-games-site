        <p class="mt-2">A group of 2-8 players step into the role of officers aboard a customizable aerial warship in the 1960s. As freedom fighters in their occupied homeland, they crew a privateer, opportunistically targeting enemy warships at their discretion, plotting the hunt, chasing their quarry and engaging it in blazing real-time combat.</p>

        <p class="mt-2">Within combat, officers fill the roles required by their ship’s design. At a minimum this includes the helm and primary battery. However, as the ship evolves and the war pushes new technologies forward, this will grow to include away-team boarding marines, combat aircraft squadrons, signals intelligence, ship damage control, and control of support airships. Every showdown will feel like a unique boss-fight, evolving over 25 - 45 minutes with the crew’s flexibility, discipline, and good decision-making matter more than placing a few accurate salvos.</p>

        <p class="mt-2">Should they succeed, the salvage and loot (or commission) for their victory allows them to up-arm their ship to hunt yet larger quarries in their quest to liberate their homeland.</p>
